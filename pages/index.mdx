# Hey Tom! 👋

Welcome to my application for the role of [Junior Web Developer](https://www.raisely.com/jobs/junior-web-developer).

I'm going to tell you why I think I'm a perfect fit for this role.

# Who am I? 🤔

My name is Joel, am a self-taught developer. Last year after COVID-19 hit, it occurred to me that I had lots of free time on my hands. I had done some HTML/CSS before but only for fun. So in May, I decided to explore the world of programming. I enrolled for CS50. Two months later, I knew there was no going back. The rest is history.

# My Skills 👨‍💻

I've dedicated a lot of time to learning web technologies and applying them in my own projects.

I've thus become **comfortable** working with

- HTML, CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript, TypeScript
- React.js, Next.js
- Styled-Components

# Why I'm Interested In Raisely

I'm not going to bore you with _'this is my dream job...everything I ever wanted bla bla bla'_

I am submitting my candidature because my passion is to work with talented people and collaborate to build products that will create impact. After a little digging [here](https://www.raisely.com/www/posts/solidarity-with-india-how-charities-on-raisely-are-helping-with-the-crisis) and [there](https://www.instagram.com/p/COdze-2DDJ8/), Raisely is where I'd love to start. I enjoy bootstrapping ideas and shipping products into reality, as well as diving into problems and issues with an open mind with the intention to learn. Working with the team at Raisely would expand my ability to translate real problems into viable solutions at scale.

I have an excellent work ethic and I love to solve difficult challenges and learn from them. Executing and learning are some things I am passionate about, which reflects my decision for applying here.

I have also worked on a remote team, an experience that taught me to be proactive and work independently without micro-management. With this background, I am able to seamlessly fit into the remote culture at Raisely.

I hope to impact and contribute to Raisely, and I look forward to speaking with you in person.

# Why You Should Hire me

All right let's get to the main point. Anyone could've told you what I just told you. Let's get to why you should even be interested.

### Am big on communication

Being a remote team I understand communication is very important to get stuff done and over the last couple of months I've worked hard to improve in this regard.

I did this by writing writing technical articles to share what I learn and learn to better express myself. I've written articles at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/codingknite/) and [Dev](https://dev.to/codingknite). These articles have been collectively viewed by over 15,000 developers.

My proudest article is this one I wrote about [Rescursion in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-recursion-in-javascript/)

### Teamwork makes the dream work

This is a core value of mine. The most notable way I've proven this is by engaging in open source.

I created a [Github repository](https://github.com/codingknite/frontend-development) where I curated useful resources for anyone trying to become a front-end developer. This repository grew to be used by over 1400 developers and got over 14 contributors.

I'm currently working to contribute to coding-coach. A great platform to find a coding mentor. [This is the issue I'm working on.](https://github.com/Coding-Coach/find-a-mentor/issues/796#issuecomment-895143924)

Am capable of working hand in hand with an engineering team and producing desired result.

Don't belive me? Here is what my previous mentor had to say about working with me on a project.

> He sought mentorship from me which grew into a good relationship and thus me hiring him for a side project of mine using NextJS and TypeScript. He has shown great dedication and proactiveness with his work. What this guy can attain in the future is something to look forward to!

### Am here to learn

Am going to be honest with you. I'm probably not the best developer you're going to come across but one thing I know for sure is I love to learn. The best way I've proven this is the fact I've been able to catapult myself into learning everything I know about development today. No bootcamp, No CS background, just me and my desire to learn and better myself everyday.

I'll definitely make a lot of mistakes but I'll learn from every single one of them.

> Joel did some mentoring sessions with me. He is passionate and with a great desire to learn. Although he has just entered the world of programming, with his intelligence and his skills, he is able to write clean code to resolve problems.
